# aoc-21-java

## Topics I realized I don't know well enough and need to be studied
* Java 8 Streams
* Open, read and write files
* Different types of data structures available in Java (including thread-safe ones)
* Iterators

## Things to refactor
* put days in different packages
* utils should just return the stream
